Next Steps

This is ONLY the beginning of your journey with web development. Many of the skills you learned here can be used across a wide variety of technologies.
Mobile Apps

Many cross-platform mobile app frameworks allow you to build a single HTML/JS/CSS application and have it distributed across iOS, Android, Windows Phone and even Blackberry devices. Your web development skills can be put to use immediately building mobile applications.
